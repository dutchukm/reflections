When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - To share your code with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Git would not know what branch you want to work on
    - Git might over write changes made to local files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Forks make copies of Github repos on Github
    - clones make copies of Github repos to your local machine
    - brances make copies of local repos on your local system

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    - You can work on your code offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    - You would need to solve all the concurancy problems that Git solves.
    - Could setup you own git server.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
